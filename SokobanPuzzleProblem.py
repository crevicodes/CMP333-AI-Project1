# square floor ( )
# wall (#)

# player (@) // can move horizentally or veritcally. but not diagonally.
# cannot pass walls or boxes
# the player has to walk next to box in order to move it.
# the player cannot pull it.
# how to define pulling and pushing?
#
# pushing : if the ($) is in front  goes in direction of
# in order to push the target square has to be empty
#
# * the number of boxes equal the number of locations -> (.) the same as ($)
#
# goal ->  boxes are at storage locations. ($) at (.) all of them
#heuristic one: consider the distance between the minimum of the boxes and the targets + the distance  of where the current (@) is, to the nearest box

# the code is taken from the pacmanproblem and modified slightly
# here the professor just implements for heuristis the straigt line
